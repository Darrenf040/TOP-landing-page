# TOP-landing-page
I will be building a landing page using basic html and css
So far i've learned the foundations of html and css which include html elements, tags, containers, inheritance etc; as far as the css side of things, i've learned the box model, css cascade, how to use inspect mode effectivly in a web browser, css displays (block, inline, flex), and how flexbox works.
Before I start building my project I want to go over the methods I will be using to build the website.
HTML: I will start with a header on the top and wrap it in a container div, then I will have content sections with their own div containers, finally I will have a footer section on the bototm also with a div container wrapped around the content. I will be using display: flex; a lot to align, and organize my content.
